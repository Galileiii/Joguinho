Gatenho Dresser is a dress-up and character customization game in the “avatar maker” style, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player can mix and match different outfits, accessories, and facial expressions to create their own unique character.

The interface is simple and intuitive, featuring side buttons to navigate between categories (clothes, hair, eyes, mouth, etc.) and arrows to switch between available items. There are also three functional buttons:

🔄 Reset: Removes all items, leaving only the base character.
❓ Random: Generates a random combination of clothes and accessories.
💾 Save: Saves the created character as an image.

The main goal of this project is to practice DOM manipulation, event listeners, image arrays, and randomization logic in JavaScript.
